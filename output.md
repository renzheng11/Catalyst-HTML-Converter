### Abstract

The article argues that transnational adoption and surrogacy from South
Korea and India are shaped through US and British imperial and colonial
histories in Korea and India respectively. We focus on the reproductive
labor of 'native companions' in early British India and *kijich'on*
(camptown) women in post--World War II Korea. The management of native
women's sexuality was crucial for maintaining social order, political
stability, and for consolidating capitalism through the commodification
and devaluation of colonized reproductive labor. The configuration of
historical legacies is unpacked through the idea of coloniality, the
constitutive dark side of modernity, which reproduces subalternity and
exploitation of racialized bodies. The reproductive labour of Korean
birth mothers and Indian surrogate mothers is formed and shaped by the
colonial and imperial formations of gender, sexuality, kinship and
family, in which white supremacy and exploitation of Indian and Korean
women was at the core. We argue that these formations are re-configured
in the present through three mechanisms that enables contemporary
practices of adoption and surrogacy: the transformation of waste into
profit, the erasure of non-white mothers, and the trope of the white
savior.

### Introduction

Transnational adoption and surrogacy are commonly perceived as opposites
on a moral spectrum ranging from humanitarianism to exploitation.
Transnational adoption in its modern form started as a war relief
effort, with the adoption of mixed-race children fathered by American
GIs in the aftermath of the Korean War (1950--1953). The language of
altruistic rescue and love instituted during this formative period still
frames the practice, while commercial surrogacy---especially when it
involves the reproductive labor of women in the Global South---is
perceived as controversial. Though adoption stakeholders emphatically
distance themselves from any link to the commodification of children,
there is a growing consensus among scholars that it is fruitful to
analyze adoption through a market framework (Raleigh 2018). Furthermore,
fraud, corruption, and child trafficking have been acknowledged as major
challenges to transnational adoption since its very beginnings. Scholars
such as US law professor David Smolin have argued that the recurrent
"scandals" featured in media reports on adoption are not exceptions but
point to the very structure of the adoption system (Smolin 2006; 2010;
Nelson 2006; Raleigh 2018).

In the present, transnational adoption is being scrutinized and
problematized, in the aftermath of a critical debate, sparked by the
discovery of illegal adoptions in Chile in 2019 (Nelsen 2021). This has
created unprecedented legal and political repercussions in some of the
largest receiving countries. In 2020 an independent investigation on
transnational adoption commissioned by the minister for Legal Protection
in the Netherlands was published (Government of the Netherlands,
Committee on the Investigation of Intercountry Adoption, 2021), followed
by the publication of similar reports in Denmark (Ankestyrelsen, 2021),
and Switzerland (Bitter, Bangerter, and Ramsauer 2020), and in Sweden,
the parliament voted for the commissioning of such an investigation
(Sköld and Lundberg*,* 2021b). As a consequence, all transnational
adoptions in the Netherlands and Denmark have been halted, and the Swiss
government has issued an official apology. The Dutch report emphasized
that the illegal and unethical practices---alongside the governmental
complicity---pertain to transnational adoption as a system. It also
identifies the social and political imagery of adoption---the good deed
of "saving children"---as crucial in the emergence and upkeeping of
abusive practices: "Because of the deep roots of this image, abuses such
as age falsification were accepted or even considered normal. Also,
anyone who helped promote adoption was seen as a benefactor, and
politicians fought for (rapid) intercountry adoption. Research has
uncovered repeated patterns of passivity and whitewashing. The view that
any adoption, even an illicit one, is better than no adoption at all was
indisputable" (Government of the Netherlands, Committee on the
Investigation of Intercountry Adoption, 2021, 3). Significantly, the
committee recommends that lessons learned from transnational adoption be
considered in the case of surrogacy. The ways in which perceptions of
morality ("doing good") can gloss over social injustices is a dimension
that will be addressed in the following analysis.

This article explores the continuities between transnational adoption
and transnational surrogacy through a shared history of imperialism and
colonialism. More specifically, we argue that imperial and colonial
regulations of native women's reproductive labor are reconfigured in
current practices of surrogacy and adoption. The centrality of the
gendered colonized body in the articulation of imperial ideologies has
often revealed fraught dynamics of cross-cultural contact. Adding to
previous scholarship on the imperial/colonial lineages of adoption and
surrogacy, we focus on the reproductive labor of "native companions" in
early British India and camptown women in post--World War II Korea, as
historical and epistemological templates for surrogacy and adoption.
Thus, our article contributes to a more robust understanding of how US
imperial history and British colonialism---in which white supremacy and
the reproductive exploitation of native women were at the core---shape
contemporary globalized reproduction. Our main contribution lies in
reading these two archives together, which enables us to discern the
workings of the colonial matrix of power (Quijano 2000) across different
geopolitical and temporal sites.

In the next section, we will situate our study within postcolonial
feminist research on transnational surrogacy and critical adoption
studies. We will then present the theoretical perspective and
methodological approach of our analysis. The first part of our analysis
deals with the regulation of inter-racial intimacies in early British
India, the (in)visibility of native women and the regulation of native
motherhood. We will then proceed to map the regulation of inter-racial
intimacies between US servicemen and Korean women in post--WWII Korea.
Finally, we argue that these historical regulations of native women's
reproductive labor are reconfigured in the present. We develop these
findings through three mechanisms that characterize contemporary
globalized adoption and surrogacy: (a) the transformation of waste into
profit, (b) the erasure of non-white mothers, and (c) the trope of the
white savior.

#### Genealogies of Stratified Reproduction

Postcolonial feminists and feminists of color have emphasized the
stratification of motherhood, that is, the ways in which race,
ethnicity, and migration status shape women's reproductive roles (Colen
1995), and how the present international division of reproductive labor
is conditioned by racial hierarchies and Western colonialism. Black US
feminists see transatlantic chattel slavery---in which the reproductive
labor of female slaves was engineered for profit---as a precursor of
surrogacy (Twine 2011; Weinbaum 2019). Drawing on Alys Weinbaum's notion
of the "imperial/colonial episteme" (2019, 59)---which posits
racialization as a mechanism through which extraction and
commodification is facilitated (also see Collins 1990)---we aim to
explore the workings of this episteme in contemporary practices of
adoption and surrogacy.

The pivotal role of racial hierarchies and Western colonialism has been
highlighted in previous scholarship on Indian surrogacy (Vora 2009,
2015; Banerjee 2014; Deomampo 2016). Kalindi Vora argues that British
colonialism constitutes the condition of possibility for Indian
surrogacy. British colonial medicine, the classical Western mechanistic
understanding of the body, more recent visual technologies that
instrumentalize the uterus, the historical devaluation of reproductive
labor, and neoliberal globalization are discerned as significant
components in Indian surrogacy in Vora's work (Vora 2015). Furthermore,
she draws parallels between surrogacy and Indian indentured labor,
arguing that the system of Indian indentured labor and Indian surrogacy
both illustrate the strategic and racialized use of critical notions
such as freedom, consent, and autonomy (Vora 2009). Analogous to
contemporary contracts regulating surrogacy in India, the contracts
regulating Indian coolie labor were fraught with significant omissions
that make ideas about freedom and consent difficult to maintain;
"consent" glosses over the absence of choices; the lack of information
and the many binding circumstances that uphold the fiction of
non-coercion underpin Indian indentured labor (Vora 2009).

In our analysis of Korean adoption, we build on research within the
field of critical adoption studies that attend to the historical,
political, and socioeconomic contexts of transnational adoption (Trenka
et al. 2006; E. Kim 2010; Briggs 2012). While previous scholarship on
transnational adoption has focused on health, medical issues, and
socio-psychological questions of adjustment and identity formation,
scholars within this field place the practice within histories of
Western colonialism and military violence, thus challenging the dominant
narrative of adoption as child rescue. Transnational adoption is seen as
a paradigmatic example of how "imperialist processes 'over there' and
social relations 'over here' intersect" (Eng 2010, 95). Hence, the
emergence of Korean adoption is not seen as the "natural" solution to
the orphan crisis, but as an expression of Cold War politics and US
empire building, with the Korean War marking the initial stage of global
hegemony. The opening up of adoption programs followed US military
invasions in Vietnam and Thailand, which then became the next major
sending countries after South Korea (Hübinette 2006, 145). When
transnational adoption spread to other countries, South Korea, which has
the longest and largest adoption program in the world, was used as a
model.

#### Theoretical Framework and Methodological Approach

We draw on the key analytical concept of "coloniality" (Quijano 2000) to
understand how configurations of gender, race, and sexuality that were
institutionalized during various phases of colonial rule have
reconfigured in current typologies of labor and capital. Coloniality is
"still the most general form of domination in the world today, once
colonialism as an explicit political order was destroyed" (Quijano 2007,
170); we have moved from a period of "global colonialism" to a current
period of "global coloniality," implying the continued subordination and
exploitation of peripheral nation-states and non-Europeans.

In his conceptualization of "coloniality of power," Aníbal Quijano
(2000) highlighted the centrality of race, which justified the
superiority of the European as the dominant subject and in relation to
whom other social categories were subordinate and inferior. The
invention of race gave rise to new social identities (Quijano 2000,
216), first using "physiognomic" traits of people as external
manifestations of their racial nature (whites, Indians, Mestizos,
Negroes, yellows, olives), and then, on that basis, "geocultural
identities" were produced (European, American, Asiatic, African) (see
Quijano 2007, 171). As Quijano states, "the relation between European
culture and the other cultures was established and has been maintained,
as a relation between 'subject' and 'object'...\[in\] a relation of
externality" (2007, 174). Sylvia Wynter draws attention to the ways in
which "human" refers to a particular ethnoclass; Man (i.e., Western
bourgeois) ''overrepresents itself as if it were the human itself''
(2003, 260)---securing its own well-being, but denying humanity to those
excluded from this globally hegemonic construct (2003, 262). Nelson
Maldonado-Torres explains how the uneven distribution of humanity among
groups that appeared human became "the foundation of the differentiation
between the idea of human being as *humanitas* as opposed to human being
as *antrophos*, the first one referring to human beings as subjects, and
the other one to a sub-set of beings...entities that generate anxiety,
fear, desire, and rage" (2017, 433). On a similar tack, Lisa Lowe
suggests that the "uses of universalizing concepts of reason,
civilization, and freedom effect colonial divisions of humanity,
affirming liberty for modern man while subordinating the variously
colonized and dispossessed peoples whose material labor and resources
were the conditions of possibility for that liberty" (2015, 6). If
coloniality was one axis in global Euro-centered capitalism, structured
through a hierarchical international division of labor, then modernity
was the other. There is "no modernity without coloniality" (Mignolo
2011, 3). In fact, the achievements of modernity are inseparable from
"colonial humiliation'' (Sakai 2010, 443).

Building on Quijano's framework of coloniality of power, María Lugones
develops an intersectionality of race and gender, positing gender "as
constituted by and constituting the coloniality of power" (2008, 3--4).
Thus, in specific historical geopolitical contexts, gender was
instrumental in the colonial domination over non-Western racialized
bodies and subjectivities---a structure that structured power. The
colonial gender system ordered lives into heteronormative and
hierarchical structures, justifying the dehumanization and enslavement
of those that fell outside these frames.

Our analysis is based on existing postcolonial literature and inspired
by Lowe's (2015) methodological approach of reading across archives: we
posit British colonialism (India) and US neo-imperialism (South Korea)
as two archives on transracial intimacies, through which we identify
convergences in contemporary regimes of reproductive labor. This
approach enables us to see how colonial/imperial histories in two
seemingly disparate and dissimilar geographical and social contexts
yielded similar outcomes---identifying unifying themes pertaining to the
reproductive labor of native women. Our reading establishes a link
between the archives without obliterating their differences. We
investigate how discursive conceptualizations that underpin exploitative
practices acquire legitimacy. To borrow from Lowe, ours is an "analysis
\[that\] does not accept given categories and concepts as fixed or
constant, but rather takes as its work the inquiry into how those
categories became established as given, and with what effects" (2015,
3). In other words, analyzing contemporary practices of globalized
reproduction through these colonial archives enables us to see the
history of the present.

### "Native Companions" in Early British India

#### Regulating Transracial Intimacies in Early British India

In this article, we focus on the period between 1700 and 1858 during
which the English East India Company established and consolidated the
foundations of British colonial rule in India. During this period,
transracial cohabitations or concubinage between European merchants and
servicemen and Indian native women were commonplace, although not
publicly recognized. The forms of cohabitation ranged from domestic and
sexual services to conjugal relations. As opposed to previous
understandings of this early stage as an era of creolization,
cosmopolitanism, and carelessness towards racial boundaries, Durba Ghosh
(2006) demonstrates how anxieties about racial purity and fears of
racial mixing are present from the outset of the Anglo-Indian encounter,
reflecting Ann Laura Stoler's observation that "who bedded and wedded
with whom in the colonies was intensely debated and meticulously
codified from the very beginning of the Imperial Era" (1989, 636--37).
Regulations and practices of transracial intimacies shifted during the
British colonial regime. The progressive colonization of India, during
which the East India Company claimed greater political authority, was
accompanied by legislations to end Anglo-Indian social intimacy under
the rule of governor general Lord Cornwallis (1786--1793). Distance
between Britons and native people was seen as necessary to uphold the
racial, national, and religious superiority of the colonizers
(McClintock 1995; Ghosh 2006). Nonetheless, interracial relationships
continued in the post-Cornwallis era.

The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a watershed moment in the political and
social history of India (Procida 2002). The Government of India Act of
1858, which marked the beginning of the British Raj, the improved
communication between Britain and India (including the opening of the
Suez Canal in 1869), and the widening distance between British and the
Indians, fueled by the rebellion, interrupted the racialized, gendered,
and sexualized economies that existed in the pre-British Raj period.
Practices of concubinage were pushed to the margins and replaced with a
different set of relationships with domestic servants, housekeepers, and
nursemaids. Efforts were made to foreground British morality and the
establishment of British monogamous heterosexual households, with the
British "memsahib" (wife of a high ranking British official) as the
upholder of this morality within the intimate space of the home
(Chaudhuri 1988, 1994).

As Ronald Hyam argues, the memsahib became the new "instrument" for
maintaining the social distance between the ruler and the ruled (1990,
19). Furthermore, domesticity, childhood, and Britishness became
intimately linked. Within the imperial home the female servant's (ayah)
surrogate motherhood and the native wet nurses' (amahs) lactating body
threatened to re-order the domestic familial organization, while
simultaneously exposing the vulnerability of English reproduction.
Though predicated on a race/class superiority of the memsahib, the
ayah's closeness to European children was a cause of colonial anxiety as
it threatened to destabilize the power hierarchies within the colonial
nursery and contest the British ideal of childhood. On the other hand,
due to their low class and caste, wet nurses were projected as
physically and morally dirty, betraying the racialized, caste, and
classed character of the relationship between the British and native
Indians in the colonial home (Sen 2009; S. Banerjee 2010). Thus, the
colonial-domestic space became a site of negotiation and contestation,
with the native female body arousing ambivalent feelings of fear and
disgust, on the one hand, but also seen as a necessary inclusion within
the British household, on the other.

#### Exploitation and Non-recognition of Native Women's Reproductive Labor

Cohabiting with a native woman was often regarded as a socially and
sexually transgressive act by the emerging colonial state (Ghosh 2006,
31), but served imperial interests in several ways. These arrangements
eliminated the responsibility and economic expense of the Company to
"import" British women. Furthermore, by remaining legally unbound, their
men were free to move on to respectable marriages with European women
who would potentially bring wealth into the marriage. European men were
thus able to maximize both sexual and economic opportunities.
Concubinage was also seen as both politically and medically beneficial,
as a way to form strategic bonds with powerful indigenous families,
while at the same time keeping "men in their barracks and bungalows, out
of brothels and less inclined to perverse liaisons with one another"
(Stoler 1989, 637). Not the least, it enabled colonial societies like
British India to imagine itself as being uncontaminated by racial and
cultural mixing (Ghosh 2006, 30), and to maintain the racial hierarchy
on which colonialism rested. As Ghosh argues, interracial intimacies
were camouflaged by the fact that indigenous women living in colonial
households were given new names: "the absence of native women's names
\[or the erasure of her identity as an indigenous woman\] in colonial
archives correlated with the state's interests to suppress the
visibility of subjects who threatened the whiteness of colonial society"
(2006, 18--19). By obscuring indigenous forms of identification, the
colonial archive systematically erased the identity of native women.

Indrani Chatterjee (1999a) has explored slavery in colonial India, which
is an under-studied theme in South Asian historiography. She argues that
a significant number of the native women cohabiting with Company men
during the early colonial period were slaves in the legal sense---that
is, they received their freedom on the death of their master. Continuous
wars over succession within provinces and battles between the British
military and local rulers created a population of women and children
available for purchase. With their homes destroyed, they would turn to
the cantonments of the Company for protection and livelihood
opportunities (Chatterjee 1999a, 64). Other women were supplied by the
system of regimental bazaars, itinerant markets that followed each
military unit and provided the troops and the regiment as a whole with
domestic and sexual services. Although prohibitions of coerced labor
were put in place at this time, exceptions were made for the category of
women and young girls recruited by force to perform these services in
the bazaars. This later developed into the *chakla* system (government
managed spaces for prostitutes) in which indigenous middlemen were
allocated funds by the local commander to deliver purchased young women
for the regiment's use.

#### Savage Mothers

While erased in the colonial archives, the "native companions" of
European men become visible through their children. The growing number
of mixed-race children become a palpable threat to the authority of
European rule---as concrete manifestations of the permeable boundaries
between the native population and the imperial rulers, and as colonial
subjects with a compromised loyalty (Stoler 1989, 2010; Ghosh 2006,
213). Thus, in 1782 the Military Orphan Society was founded by officers
of the East India Company with the purpose of managing the effects of
racial mixing. This group of children was seen as the literal
incarnation of the harmful effects of miscegenation, including excessive
sexuality, and the influence of the native mothers was seen as
detrimental to the children, particularly in upper-class families, where
a perceived lack of chastity, fidelity, and other moral qualities made
them unfit to parent the offspring of English gentlemen. Therefore, the
orphanages also served the crucial purpose of separating children from
their native mothers.

Native women with biracial children were systematically targeted with a
range of legal and administrative measures that undermined their social
recognition as mothers. For instance, before the age of four, at which
admittance to the orphan school was compulsory, every child was entitled
to a monthly allowance, a prerequisite being that the child was cared
for by a close relative. However, the native mother or her family were
not eligible as such. Instead, in the absence of close relatives, it was
required that a serviceman in the regiment registered as the child's
guardian, or the child would commonly be taken into custody. Tying
financial aid to a particular regiment made native mothers' prospects of
supporting and living with their children dependent on their ability to
find a European guardian---a precarious position which pushed them into
a series of intimate relationships with soldiers of the same regiment.
Native mothers "circulated through the households of soldiers in a
regiment in order to maintain their livelihoods and their ties to their
children" (Ghosh 2006, 232). These women were perceived as promiscuous,
which further sedimented the idea of native women as unfit mothers.

Chatterjee (1999b) demonstrates how this undermining of native women's
motherhood becomes manifest when compared to indigenous systems of
slavery. In the latter, the child born to a slave-concubine inherited
the father's legal status, which allowed for filiation,
status-reckoning, and incorporation into the slave-holding household.
This entailed advantages in terms of status and continued protection for
the mother of the child. In contrast, according to colonial law and
practice, the offspring of slave-women inherited the mother's juridical
status. Mothers of children fathered by European free men were seen as
"illegitimate" and could make no claims to their children.

These practices were bolstered by imperial ideologies of race and
gender. Colonized women deviated from the norm of both *humanitas*
(Maldonado-Torres 2017) and the norm of womanhood modeled on white
bourgeoisie women. Thus, for native women, colonization brought both
"racial inferiorization and gender subordination" (Lugones 2008, 8).
While white European women were seen as fragile and sexually passive,
colonized women were constructed as sexually aggressive and perverse
(Cott 1978). Felicity Nussbaum (1995) argues that the eighteenth century
marks the formation of the cult of domesticity, wherein hierarchies of
class and race among women were expressed through their quintessential
role as mothers. An "English" and "civilized" motherhood was ascribed
according to class position, and further distinguished in opposition to
the savage motherhood of the racialized women in the colonies: "women of
the upper and middle classes are pitted against lower-class women and
'civilized' English mothers against 'barbaric' mothers---their
difference a proof of racial and class superiority, their sameness an
indication of their gendered inferiority in an interlocking network of
hierarchies" (Nussbaum 1995, 126). Capable of killing, eating, or giving
away their children, native mothers, otherwise pictured as closer to
animals and a regime of primordial instincts, were paradoxically seen to
lack maternal instinct. As Stoler (1989, 647) has shown, the idea of
native mothers as harmful to their children and the subsequent removal
and institutionalization of mixed-race children is a recurrent pattern
not only from British India but also from French Indochina, the Dutch
Indies, and white settler colonies in North America (the American Native
Indian boarding schools in the United States, the Indian residential
school system in Canada), and Australia (the Stolen Generations).

### US Neo-imperialism and Korean Birth Mothers

#### Post--WWII Korea

In Korea, the victory of the Allied forces over the Axis powers at the
end of WWII put an end to thirty-five years of Japanese colonial rule.
Drawing up an arbitrary border at the 38^th^ parallel, the Cold War
superpowers---charged with the task of overseeing the retreat of the
Japanese army---divided the peninsula, with the Soviet Union (backed by
China) taking charge of the northern part and the United States
(supported by the UN) claiming the southern part. In September 1945, the
United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) was created.
But the process towards independence was stalled as post-WWII turned
into Cold War politics and the conflicting interests of the two
superpowers, who stood face to face on the Korean peninsula, escalated.
The USSR and US each installed ideologically attuned Korean-led
governments, turning Korea into a testing ground for democracy versus
communism. Because of its proximity to the Soviet border, the American
military presence was seen as a way to both ensure Korean independence
and prevent communist expansion in East Asia. In the years after WWII,
South Korea received massive war relief from the international
community, in particular the US, to rebuild its shattered economy. The
US economic assistance became increasingly geared towards making Korea a
strong yet subordinate partner in the Cold War. A system of dependency
was mounted, in which political and social problems were solved by
economic contributions. As South Korea gained independence in 1948, the
Republic of Korea--US Agreement on Aid preserved the structures
established during the rule of the USAMGIK.

#### Camptown Women

The establishment of US military camps throughout the southern peninsula
was accompanied by the construction of camptowns, or
*kijich'ons*---areas adjacent or in close proximity to military bases
that provided services, not the least sexual services, for soldiers. In
some cases, the American troops would take over and expand already
existing "comfort stations" set up by the Japanese army, including the
women who lived there. Thus, as suggested by scholarship on Korean
comfort women and early camptown women, there is no clear distinction
between the two categories (Moon 1997; Cho 2008). The first generation
of camptown women (1950--1970) came from poor rural areas where the war
had created a large supply of girls and women without families and
livelihoods, and for whom prostitution became a means for survival. Some
considered themselves to be "fallen women" even before entering the
camptowns, having lost their social status as a result of divorce, rape,
or sex and/or pregnancy outside wedlock. A few of these women would
marry American servicemen, while others entered into "contract
cohabitations," in which women were provided living expenses in return
for a monogamous relationship (Moon 1997, 25--26). As Akeia Benard
(2016) notes, these Cold War--era relationships were similar to the
forms of interracial domestic arrangements that flourished in British
India and other colonial settings during the imperial era.

Myths of the sexual availability and compliance of women of color were
pivotal to sustain white masculinity and white male supremacy during
both the European imperial era and the Cold War (Benard 2016, 3). In the
case of US-Korea relations, orientalist stereotypes were used to attract
young American men to enter into military service on the peninsula (Moon
1997, 33). To the emerging South Korean state, camptown women's sexual
labor was perceived as a guarantee for the safety and the honor of the
nation as kijich'on women were seen as protecting the virtue of innocent
Korean national womanhood from the perceived predatory sexuality of
American soldiers. Nevertheless, working as a military prostitute was
deeply stigmatized, as it breached against both neo-Confucianist norms
of female chastity and the idea of the Korean people as a racially
homogenous nation (Hübinette 2006; H. Kim 2016, 50; Moon 1997, 3).
Camptown women were commonly also rejected by their own families, even
when it was through their labor that the family was able to survive.
Although officially outlawed by the USAMGIK in 1946, prostitution
increased during the American occupation: by 1953 there were 350,000
prostitutes in Korea, with 60 percent working around US military bases
throughout the 1950s and 1960s (Cho 2008, 104). However, the link
between prostitution and the American army was never recognized by the
US Department of State (Cho, 2008, 101). In 1948, following South Korean
independence, prostitution was banned by the South Korean government,
but an exception was made for camptowns. During the military
dictatorship of Park Chunghee (1961--1979), kijich'on women were
officially recognized and encouraged to act as "diplomats" for their
nation (Cho 2008, 110). As Katharine Moon notes, although most countries
have prostitution, what sets the South Korean case apart is that it was
both sanctioned and sponsored by the government (1997, 41).

#### Unwed Mothers, Mixed-Race Orphans, and Racial Discrimination

The Korean War had devastated the country, killed over one million
civilians and displaced tens of thousands of children. The majority were
mixed-race children who had been abandoned by their parents. According
to Korean law, mothers were not recognized as the legal guardian of
children born out of wedlock, which made the children illegitimate. Both
women and their mixed-race offspring, particularly the children of
African American servicemen, were seen as social outcasts and exposed to
racial discrimination (Okazawa-Rey 1997; Cho 2008, 118). Camptown
mothers carried the double stigma of miscegenation and illegitimacy (E.
Kim 2010, 51). In both colonial India and South Korea, mixed-race
children were seen as a problem. However, as Tobias Hübinette explains,
adoption as the "solution" to this problem represents a historically
significant shift from "the way the French, Dutch and British empires in
Asia dealt with the problem of mixed children fathered by European
settlers before World War II. Few, if any of these were ever adopted and
moved to metropolitan Europe" (2006, 144).

The task of rehabilitating the country was assigned to the US military,
through programs such as the Armed Forces Assistance to Korea, and the
military unit, the Korea Civil Assistance Command. In reconstructing the
social welfare system, the construction of orphanages became a top
priority, which illustrates how geopolitical agendas were framed as
humanitarian interventions. As SooJin Pate and others have observed,
"the acts of recovery performed by the U.S. military worked to cover
over the acts of state violence that necessitated the need for recovery
in the first place" (2014, 39). American news media contributed by
broadcasting footage of GIs rescuing children from ruins and handing out
presents at Christmas parties, which represented the American soldier as
a kind of "pseudo-missionary" (Pate 2014). The emergence of Korean
adoption was intimately linked to anti-communism and "Christian
Americanism": a patriotic ideology that conflates Christian principles
with "American values," articulated as a specifically American moral
authority (Oh 2015). The Korean mixed-race children were seen as
humanitarian orphans to be rescued, rather than as children abandoned by
their American fathers (E. Kim 2010, 53), and as opposed to the native
mothers in British India, Korean kijich'on women were not entitled to
any legal protection or practical assistance from the US military (H.
Kim 2016, 49). Interestingly, the sense of responsibility and
entitlement that transnational adoption builds on was facilitated by an
erasure of the ways in which the US was complicit in creating "the
Korean orphan crisis."

Early orphanages and adoption policies specifically targeted mixed-race
children. Hosun Kim (2016) has shown that kijich'on mothers were
persistently solicited by adoption agency workers who actively counseled
them to relinquish their children. Only 25 percent of camptown mothers
raised their children themselves (H. Kim 2016, 46). The overseas
adoption of mixed-race orphans became a way to remove a population that
challenged the ideas of Korean patriarchy and of Korea as a pure and
racially homogenous nation, articulated through the ideology of one
nation and one people (Hübinette 2006; H. Kim 2016, 50). Thus, in this
initial phase, transnational adoption was established as a technology
for population control and the removal of "excess" populations (H. Kim
2016, 50, 66; Hübinette 2006). The US involvement also aligned with the
new South Korean government's economic interests: national security and
the building up of military forces, not social welfare, were top
priorities. Furthermore, not only was it a practice that lowered state
spendings, it became a significant source of foreign capital to the
emerging South Korean state (E. Kim 2010, 32).

Previous research has highlighted demographic shifts in the US and the
conflation of anti-communism, evangelical Christianity, and US
paternalism on the global stage as driving forces behind Korean adoption
(E. Kim 2010; Oh 2008; Nelson 2006; Briggs 2012). Christina Klein (2003)
suggests that the family becomes the dominant metaphor for understanding
US-Asia relations in the 1950s. Viewing foreign relations as sentimental
familial bonds made it possible for white Americans to imagine non-white
Asians as part of their family. The creation of this group of privileged
migrants is particularly noteworthy against the history of US anti-Asian
immigration policies: the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) and the 1924
Immigration Act, which had practically made it impossible for Asians to
immigrate legally to the United States (Lowe 2015).

A crucial step in transforming the social orphan into an adoptable child
was to erase the native mother. The birth mothers were subjected to a
process similar to that of their children: exposed to "social death"
through the stripping of all social recognition and rights, reflected in
their lack of "the right to ask for rights" pertaining to the child" (J.
Kim 2009, 857; H. Kim 2016, 9). In the early period, it was primarily
Christian, white, middle-class families who adopted Korean children. If
adoption is a technology to shore up the ideal white nuclear family (Eng
2010), it is important to add that it relies on the invisiblized
reproductive labor of the single/unwed/immoral/prostitute birth mother.

Patriarchal family practices and South Korean law give mothers little
power over their children's lives. Relinquishing a child for adoption
has not always required the consent of the birth mother. Lax
governmental oversight has allowed adoption agencies to deploy ethically
ambiguous practices for claiming custody of a child. In 1972 *Kyunghyang
Daily News* reported that agencies customarily required only the
father's consent in the relinquishment process (E. Kim 2010). Birth
mothers' lack of legal protection and the broad criteria for adoptable
children has made a large group of women---including divorced women,
poor mothers, single mothers, women involved with married men, and
mothers who leave home because of domestic abuse---vulnerable to losing
their children to adoption. Mothers who leave their children for
whatever reason lose all rights to their children. It has not been
uncommon for mothers to discover that their child has been relinquished
after the formal process of adoption has been completed.

### Unpacking the Coloniality of Power Nexus in Korean Adoption and Indian Surrogacy

#### Transforming Waste into Profit

We exemplify the workings of coloniality of power through what we
understand as three intersecting trajectories: (a) the transformation of
waste into profit, (b) the devaluation/erasure of non-white mothers, and
(c) the trope of the white savior. First, in both cases, neoliberal
state policies are intertwined with the exploitation of sexual and
reproductive labor of women who do not fit the national imaginary,
transforming devalued populations seen as "waste" into profit-generating
resources.

In early British India, practices of concubinage lowered economic
expenses while creating and maintaining racially unequal relations. This
inequality has informed contemporary surrogacy practices. For roughly a
decade (2004--2015), India stood as the world's "mother destination" for
commercial gestational surrogacy. Low costs, the availability of highly
qualified English-speaking medical doctors and women willing to work as
surrogates, together with the lack of legal regulation surrounding
surrogacy arrangements, contributed to India's flourishing fertility
industry. Overall, surrogacy has benefited from the active promotion and
financial support of the Indian government (Rudrappa 2015; Deompampo
2016).

The viewing of Indian women's bodies as excessively reproductive and
fertile and thus inimical to development and progress was first
formulated during British colonial rule and then reconfigured by the
postcolonial Indian state and policy makers in the Global North (Wilson
2018). Paradoxically, the same wombs that were seen as superfluous,
dangerous, and wasteful, and thus requiring anti-natalist interventions,
are now seen as profitable and lucrative sources of revenue for
stakeholders within the fertility industry (Pande 2014; Rudrappa 2018).

Similarly, the sexual and reproductive exploitation of Korean women
after WWII was facilitated both by the South Korean and the US
government, motivated by political as well as financial gains. In the
postwar construction period, the transnational adoption of mixed-race
children became a significant source of foreign capital (E. Kim 2010,
32). In the 1960s and 1970s, a decline in the number of mixed-race
children paralleled with a booming interest in the US to adopt Korean
children, leading to practices such as baby hunting and financial
renumeration to birth mothers (E. Kim 2010). The demographics of birth
mothers has shifted since its initial years. Vulnerable to South Korea's
aggressive modernization policies, poor female factory workers were
counseled by adoption agency workers to relinquish their children (E.
Kim 2010, 72). By the 1970s, the children of unmarried college students
came to dominate, and by the late 1990s, teen pregnancies became the
largest group, maintaining single or unmarried mothers as most
vulnerable to losing their children (Briggs 2012). Until the 1990s,
family members were able to hand over children for adoption against the
mother's will or without her knowledge. Today, South Korea is the
world's twelfth largest economy and has the world's lowest birth rates,
yet adoption continues (Shin 2020). Approximately 90 percent of the
children adopted oversees in recent years have unmarried birth mothers
in their late teens or early twenties (E. Kim 2010, 34). News reports
indicate that unwed mothers are pressured to give up their children for
adoption through the guise of "counseling" organized by adoption
agencies who have economic interests in recruiting children for adoption
(Sköld and Lundberg 2021a).

Throughout its history, Korean adoption reflects the stigmatization and
lack of social and financial support that out-of-wedlock motherhood is
associated with in the country. Furthermore, these adoption practices
have undermined the construction of child welfare policies in the
country and been complicit in the disenfranchisement of Korean women.
Overall, the history of Korean adoption is closely intertwined with
South Korea's postcolonial process of modernization and current wealth
(H. Kim 2016, 36--37; Pate 2014), serving both economic and political
ends. As Pate notes, adoption transformed "South Korea's social
outcasts...into useful subjects for the state. As adoptees, they became
economically profitable for South Korea and politically beneficial for
the United States" (2014, 103). Thus, since its beginnings,
transnational adoption has turned undesired, "excessive" populations
into a site of economic profit generation (H. Kim 2016, 36--37; Pate
2014, 118).

#### Erasing the Non-white Mother

Second, during the British colonial rule in India, native mothers were
seen as detrimental to children and stripped of all legal and social
recognition as mothers. As opposed to an ideal white motherhood, native
mothers were constructed as unfit to nurture the offspring of white men.
The omission of their names in the colonial archive is mirrored in
contemporary birth certificates of children born through surrogacy in
India, which bear no trace of the surrogate mother. Furthermore, by
freighting in concepts of racial medicalization, Indian surrogates
become perceived as sites of risk and danger to the fetus they gestate
(Deomampo 2016). This mode of thought illustrates a colonial episteme
according to which the body is commodified through fragmentation. We
argue that this episteme is manifested through the myth of the empty
womb as separated from the self and the rest of the body and therefore
possible to "rent." Such a construction implies "instituting artificial
and rigid lines of separation between the Indian surrogate's womb and
the rest of her body...between the biological and the affective,"
pushing surrogates to "completely disengage from several critical
aspects of their identities" (A. Banerjee 2014, 124). We understand this
violent imposition to be made possible by the coloniality of power:
through the non-recognition of the surrogate as fully human. While it
can be argued that processes of fragmentation and commodification are
mobilized in all commercial surrogacy arrangements, we nonetheless
suggest that some racialized bodies are more easily seen as dispensable.
Thus, the predominantly white, heterosexual parents who seek fertility
treatment in India rely on the non-recognized reproductive labor of
Indian surrogates (Gondouin 2014; Deomampo 2016; Gondouin,
Thapar-Björkert, and Ryberg 2018).

Similarly, the erasure of the birth mother has been crucial throughout
the history of transnational adoption. Kijicho'on women were constructed
as immoral, unsuitable mothers and lacked legal rights to their
children. The process of turning a mixed-race child into an adoptable
orphan required the erasure of the native mother, a procedure that was
institutionalized in the dominant practice of "hard" or plenary
adoptions introduced in the 1960s, which grants the child a new birth
certificate that replaces the birth parents with the adoptive parents.
Thus, importantly, transnational adoption as a means through which white
middle-class nuclear families and white heteronormative kinship are
created and sustained depends on the invisibilized reproductive labor of
the single/unwed/immoral/prostitute Korean birth mother (Eng 2010; Pate
2014).

In her pioneering work on Korean birth mothers, Hosu Kim highlights "how
racialized, working class, poor birth mothers in the Global South are
disproportionately devalued and delimited to a woman's capacity to bear
a life, while their opportunities to parent that life are severely
curtailed" (2016, 9). This stratification of reproductive labor is
visible in current geopolitical conflicts, such as the highly mediatized
example of the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy at the
US-Mexican border in 2018--2019, when children of asylum seekers were
separated from their caregivers and placed in "tender age" government
shelters, from which some of them entered the US foster care and
adoption system (Briggs 2020). Laura Briggs (2020) underscores the broad
mobilization against the policy, made possible by drawing parallels
between the separations at the Southern border and histories of slavery.
However, when the Trump administration strategically referred to
immigrants as parents putting their children at risk (because of
criminal records or neglectfulness), it resuscitated the historically
familiar trope of Black and native women's lack of maternal feelings and
deficient parenthood. Subsequently, the critique became more muted
(Briggs 2020, 165--66). We argue that a coloniality of power framework
enables us to problematize practices of adoption and fostering that
privilege the rights of white parents, seen as "better families," at the
expense of limiting the ability of non-white individuals *to parent*.

#### Saving Children from Brown Mothers: The White Savior

[Third, in colonial India, the trope of the white savior (Hughey 2014)
enabled white men and women to occupy a moral high ground vis-à-vis the
colonized subjects, thus aiding those perceived as "less fortunate"
while simultaneously fulfilling the "white man's burden," "that
reputable colonial malaise, that sanctioned the subjugating of entire
continents'' (Kabbani 1994, 5--6). Though British women's experiences of
imperialism were ambiguous, they were not the hapless onlookers of the
empire, but complicit in upholding the idea of moral superiority and
agents of civilization (Burton 1990), drawing "their capital from
others' deprivation while refusing to accept \[their\] own position as
endowed" (Chow 1993, 14). Chatterjee (1999a; 1999b) observes how British
men purchasing children or female slaves perceived of their role as that
of saviors, "rescuing" the native from a miserable life subjected to the
cruelty of indigenous communities. As previous scholarship has
highlighted, a similar rhetoric of rescue is often mobilized amongst
commissioning parents contracting a woman from the Global South as their
surrogate (]{.mark}Pande 2014; Rudrappa 2015; Deomampo 2016)[. Paying a
poor woman for her service is seen as offering "help." This rhetoric has
also been understood as a way to manage anxieties regarding the
potential exploitation involved in surrogacy.]{.mark}

[In the case of transnational adoption, the trope of the white savior
has been central since its inception in postwar Korea. The intersecting
ideologies of race, gender, and sexuality that made Korean war orphans
objects of rescue by American Christianism and anti-communism are
reconfigured in contemporary media representations of adoption.
Recurrent images of celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Mia Farrow, or
Lady Diana, "saving, rescuing, or adopting international children from
underprivileged parts of the world" (Shome 2011, 389) construct a
discourse of white women as "global mothers." Global motherhood is a
specific, contemporary reconfiguration through which whiteness
articulates a new universality drawing on Christian visual tropes and
culturally specific contexts (Gondouin 2015). The availability of
children for transnational adoption is presented as the result of the
faulty motherhood of the birth mother, formulated in terms of a lack in
modernity and structured by a logic of abandonment. This understanding
"obscures the historical and political context...and positions white
citizens as rescuers and racial others as beneficiaries, making...the
attitude towards the other a question of mercy and compassion" (Gondouin
2015, 106). In a previous study, we analyzed the critically acclaimed TV
series *Top of the Lake: China Girl* (Campion 2017), and demonstrated
how the discourse of global motherhood is enacted in the context of
surrogacy, as the white female protagonists are represented as the
saviors of passive and silenced Thai sex workers who are also surrogates
(Gondouin,]{.mark} Thapar-Björkert, and Ryberg [2018).]{.mark}

[The trope of white saviors and white global motherhood is associated
with the rhetoric of the gift, which is a significant component in
narratives of transnational surrogacy. Pande (2014) has observed how a
rhetoric of the gift serves a crucial role for surrogate mothers:
understanding their labor as a gift becomes a strategy to resist the
commodification entailed in commercial surrogacy. While both rescue and
gift indicate logics that oppose systems of commodification, the notion
of the gift, in contrast to rescue, implies reciprocity, which was
interestingly actively resisted by the commissioning parents interviewed
in Daisy Deomampo's (2016) study. We suggest that this refusal can be
understood in the light of Maldonado-Torres's reading of colonial
subjugation. Maldonado-Torres sees the condition of the colonized as
equivalent to the "damné" (the condemned) in Franz Fanon's writing.
Noting that there is an etymological relation between "damner" and
"donner," he explicates the meaning of the damné as "literally the
subject who cannot give because what he or she has has been taken away
from him or her" (Maldonado-Torres 2007, 258). The reluctance of
intended parents to recognize reciprocity articulates with an
understanding of colonial subjugation as a mode of existence that makes
gift-giving and generous reception impossible.]{.mark}

### Conclusion

[In this paper, we argue that the legacies of US imperialism and British
colonial rule are reflected in Korean adoption and Indian surrogacy
through three key mechanisms: the transformation of waste into profit,
the devaluation and/or erasure of non-white mothers, and the trope of
the white savior. The latter, with its potential ethical pitfalls,
speaks to the observations of the Dutch governmental]{.mark}

[report on intercountry adoption. Our analysis of the colonial/imperial
regimes of reproductive labor in South Korea and India, two seemingly
disparate bio- and geopolitical contexts, underscores the centrality of
raced, sexed, classed, and ethnicized bodies as sites through which
imperial/colonial power was imagined and exercised. Native women's
bodies have historically been a subject of anxiety and surveillance for
imperial officials, and their management crucial for social order and
political stability. Our analysis further foregrounds how the narrative
of modernity is supported in and through the violence(s) of coloniality:
juxtaposing notions of freedom, success, and visibility with erasure,
marginalization, and exploitation. We hope that our analysis has
rendered visible histories of inequality that shape women's reproductive
choices, alerting us to some of the ways in which imperial/colonial
regimes of exploitation inform contemporary practices of globalized
reproduction.]{.mark}
