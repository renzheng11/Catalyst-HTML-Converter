        Pollination is a lynchpin anchoring multispecies survival, but in the racial capitalist configurations of
        condensed environment agriculture, pollination politics are informed by life-depleting and carceral logics, as
        well as imaginaries steeped in racial hierarchies and sex binaries that ground future survival in colonial,
        heteropatriarchal, and normative terms. This article argues that pollination politics are focused on
        intensifying agriculture and increasing yield within carceral infrastructures, and that the orchestration of
        pollination is governed by socio-sexual schemas about fitness and fecundity that are governed by a normative
        reproductive futurism. Joining feminist STS and queer theory, the article traces how forms of life in
        greenhouses and other agricultural infrastructures are “gardened” in the interests of modes of sustainability
        that are fundamentally exploitative. Biodiversity is domesticated and depoliticized, and all forms of human and
        non-human vitality are directed towards increased yield. The naturalization of sexual difference influences how
        plant life is managed, but also how temporary foreign labor is biopolitically managed in controlled environment
        agricultural infrastructures. The article reads the perverse politics of scarcity through the South African film
        <i>Glasshouse</i> 2021) and ends by speculating on how “wild pollination” might present more decolonial,
        anti-racist, queer, and liberatory sustainable futures.

    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">Introduction</p>
    <p class="c1">
        Pollination is a lynchpin anchoring multispecies survival. Wind, water, birds, insects, butterflies, bats, and
        other animals move pollen, and all disrupted by intensifying resource extraction and ecosystem degradation. In
        2006, the calamitous prospect of bee colony collapse among Apis mellifera (the European honeybee) indexed the
        broad disruptions to pollination caused by anthropogenic climate change, pesticide use, and industrial
        agriculture. It was thought that bees would disappear, and with them the end of cross-pollinating plant species
        (Ragsdale, Hackett, and Kaplan 2007, 280).<sup><a href="#note1b"
            id="note1t">1</a></sup> Speculations on the multiple potential causes of mass bee death
        included cellphone waves, co-infections, nutritional deficits, chemical pesticide and insecticide use, viruses
        and infectious mites, and migratory stress resulting from repeatedly moving colonies to farms and industrial
        greenhouses. While the threat of colony collapse has since receded from the headlines, concerns persist about
        the capacity of pollinators to sustain current agricultural systems, particularly as climate change threatens
        food production worldwide.
        <br><br>
        In the condensed spaces of so-called Agriculture 4.0,2 greenhouses and other controlled environment agriculture
        infrastructures (CEAs) have come to play an important role in articulating naturecultural relations of
        pollination, alongside hydration, light, temperature control, and optimized species development. They do so
        specifically by controlling interior atmospheres and by orchestrating relations among plants, pollinators,
        people, and technology within the condensed spaces of growing. How commercial greenhouses shape growing
        conditions, inform multispecies interactions, and fine-tune yield matter, not just for food security but also
        for the modes of kinship and flourishing that will sustain us going forward. Greenhouses are one form in a
        larger infrastructure of late capitalist agribusiness, but given their rapid growth in the last decade (spurred
        in part by the drop in prices of LED lighting), their capacity to enclose and enfold a set of controlled
        multispecies interactions, and their modeling of food security in an era of increased climate crisis, they
        provide a privileged epistemic angle for thinking about questions of liveliness, flourishing, yield, and energy.
        I see greenhouses as important forms for thinking about how sustainable food production is put into practice (or
        not) in complex assemblages of plants, temporary foreign laborers, bees, AI technologies, sensors, and
        mechanical pollinating technologies (Bell, Spooner-Hart, and Haigh 2006, 437).3 Greenhouses are also compelling
        settings for staging the utopic and dystopic imaginaries of future survival because they enclose and orchestrate
        a web of cross-species relations in a structural form. They thus continually metaphorize and demetaphorize food
        politics and multispecies entanglement.
        <br><br>
        While contemporary commercial greenhouses are frequently governed by ongoing and persistent racial capitalist
        logics (and specifically what Katherine McKittrick [2013] calls “plantation futures”), our collective future
        nevertheless depends on innovations in food security, on shoring up spaces of flourishing and nourishment around
        the world in the face of desertification, flooding, heat waves, fires, and other increasing environmental
        catastrophes. The capitalist configurations of Agriculture 4.0, however, put pressure on plants to increase
        yield through genetic alteration and control of growing atmospheres; pressure on precaritized foreign labor to
        work without security, residency, or rest through the terms of temporary labor contract; pressure on bee
        colonies to service the condensed agricultural landscapes that are still the rule through enforced detention of
        bee populations and controlled commercial breeding; and pressure on energy infrastructures to provide CEAs with
        water, electricity, and light.
        <br><br>
        I argue that pollination politics are informed by the life-depleting and carceral logics of global capitalism,
        as well as by imaginaries steeped in racial hierarchies and sex binaries that ground future survival in
        colonial, heteropatriarchal, and normative terms. First, such politics materially enable an intensified
        agriculture within the confines of new greenhouse structures (partially through the breeding of A. mellifera and
        B. bombus) and a multiplication of borders in the global system. Through bordering regimes, commercial
        agribusiness infrastructures put plant species, pollinators, and pollination technologies on the move, alongside
        racialized temporary migrant labor, and expropriate vital energy from the Global South to “insourced”
        agricultural infrastructures in North America, Europe, and East Asia, among others. Second, epistemologically
        and politico-aesthetically, these controlled environment atmospheres of growing are shaped by socio-sexual
        schemas that mediate and mobilize pollination, breed and control bee species, and generate produce through
        potent fictions about fitness and fecundity. Such fictions maintain the hegemonic priority of certain subjects
        over others and the structures of reproductive normativity along sexual and racial lines.
        <br><br>
        Thus, while we need new solutions to ensure our future survival, we also need better kinship relations to ensure
        that our visions of flourishing are more evenly distributed (among humans and nonhumans alike), and that our
        multispecies entanglements do not in fact serve expropriative aims. We must imagine at once better laboring
        relations, better growing relations, better pollinating relations, and better kinship ties to build futures that
        are less normatively coercive and less exploitative for people, plants, and pollinators. We need more “wild”
        forms of pollination, literally and metaphorically. Only then can we imagine the shelters of greenhouses as real
        forms of flourishing and refuge in the face of temperature changes, drought, desertification, ongoing imperial
        exploitation, and other crises.
        <br><br>
        I examine the material force of multispecies entanglement in intensive agricultural infrastructures,
        particularly circling around the politics of pollination. While many of these scenes take place in greenhouse
        enclosures, I argue that the greenhouse is also an epistemic angle for understanding the systems thinking in
        which pollination comes to be controlled. I join this analysis with an account of the imaginaries of
        reproductive futurism that inform visions of sustainability, well beyond the figures of the child or the family
        to which this critique is frequently bound in queer theory. Next, through a reading of the South African film
        Glasshouse, I draw out the implications of such imaginaries on green politics such as “reduce, reuse, and
        recycle.” I end by thinking speculatively about what a politics of “wild pollination” might bring to imagine
        more just, antiracist, feminist, and queer ecological politics.

        The Politics of Pollination
    </p>

    <p class="c1">
        A. mellifera (the European honey bee) is a key pollinator, reared and commercialized alongside intensive
        agricultural systems around the world. Its natural range originally extended from northern Europe to southern
        Africa, and from Britain to the Ural Mountains, western Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. It includes more than
        twenty-five subspecies, with four lineages that were allopatric until large-scale transportation and mixing of
        A. mellifera populations occurred alongside imperial expeditions (Carreck 2008, 319). A. mellifera’s
        introduction to the North American continent dates to imperial forays from Italy, Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere
        in the 1600s, where honey became a common food in the settler colonies. Their continued breeding and trade
        traces the global routes of transnational capital, as well as the accidental forces of hurricane winds, and
        their own wayward movement across the North American continent (Crosby 2004, 189). Most importations of honey
        bees into North America and Australia took place from the early seventeenth century to the twentieth century.
        The development of steamship services in the mid-nineteenth century between Europe and the United States reduced
        the time required to cross the Atlantic Ocean and enabled the shipment of bees (largely Italian honey bees) from
        apiaries in Germany and Italy (Cobey, Sheppard, and Tarpy 2012, 27). The species has a complex history,
        entangled in imperial worldmaking, plantation economies, and racial capitalism.
        <br><br>
        Scientific literature on pollination ecosystems has argued that A. mellifera was a perfect complement to
        intensive agricultural systems—in other words, to “relatively large crop areas with little or no natural
        vegetation within the agricultural matrix as well as a short time period for pollination as a result of the
        deliberately high level of flowering synchrony within a crop field” (Melin et al. 2014, 1). This argument
        ignores how transformation of the bee species—its exoskeleton, nervous system, digestive tract, and collective
        social behavior—have been remade by federal laboratories, backyard beekeepers, industrial agriculture, and
        global climate change (Kosek 2010, 651). Jake Kosek (2010) notes how beehives have been reconstructed to allow
        easy observation and manipulation by beekeepers, as well as transportation on the back of semitrucks to serve as
        pollinators at sites separated by thousands of miles. These beehive transformationshave also led to the
        transformation of bee colonies’ social organization (Kosek 2010, 651).
        <br><br>
        For Kosek (2010), the history of beekeeping and beehives are entwined with bioengineers at national
        laboratories, military strategists, mathematicians, military contractors, and others. His rich multisited and
        multispecies ethnography is worth considering on its own terms, particularly insofar as beekeeping is part of
        the history of imperial expansion and military applications. Of particular interest here, however, is how
        ecological practices are entwined with broader questions of cultural politics of nature and difference, and the
        political economy of the production of living organisms, which he also follows (Reade et al. 2015, 440).
        Dependence on the high yield of certain crops, and the extended growing cycles greenhouses enable, accompanies
        the global logistics of the commercial bee trade. The commercial bumble bee industry breeds and supplies bees
        year round and worldwide for pollination in greenhouse and other condensed agricultural crops, particularly
        tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and herbs. This global movement of commercially bred bees has an impact on the
        pollinating relations among insects, plants, and humans in local ecosystems around the world (Reade et al. 2015,
        437).
        <br><br>
        Bees are thus instrumentalized within coercive pollination politics to serve the interests of monocrop
        agriculture and its productivity metrics. These politics rely on technologies such as LED lighting to surpass
        and exceed diurnal cycles, which have effects on the labor time required in CEAs and thus solicit the turn to
        historical founts of racialized labor from the Global South to meet the needs of fourteen-hour growth cycles.
        Bees are at once commodities, inputs, laborers, and nonhuman species life in CEA systems. The infrastructures of
        greenhouse—because of the technical extension of growing time—coerce labor not only from temporary foreign
        workers but from bee species and from the plants themselves to maximize yield and respond to just-in-time
        production schedules. In this sense, they constitute a particularly interesting conceptual category for thinking
        how human-nonhuman entanglements are constituted within the agrilogistics of contemporary life. They point to an
        orchestration of plant-bee relations that is profoundly coerced and carceral, enclosed within the technological
        system of the greenhouse infrastructure.
        <br><br>
        In examining the pollination politics of greenhouse enclosures, I ally with Sarah Ives’s point that multispecies
        ethnography seeks to blur the boundaries of human and nonhuman not only to move beyond a human-centric analysis,
        but to disrupt hierarchies of power, to understand how blurring the lines of the human and nonhuman was
        distinctly violent, justifying land dispossession and genocide (Ives 2019, 2). Patent regimes, the appropriation
        of botanical knowledge, and of plant specimens also form part of the histories of transplantation, colonialism,
        and displacement that feed into contemporary agricultural emplotments (Foster 2019, 2). Pollination politics
        have been central to the organizational infrastructures of the plantation, the monocrop field, and the CEA,
        demanding modalities of fertilization to compensate for soils, bodies, and biodiverse assemblages rendered
        depleted and destitute.
        <br><br>
        Some of the literature—in its attempts to blur boundaries and disrupt hierarchies—has effected compelling
        reversals around questions of pollination, positing playfully that plants themselves may “use humans as
        pollinators to colonize new territories” (Szczygielska & Cielemęcka, 4). Catriona Sandilands argues that, if the
        flower is the plant’s sex organ, it signifies an invitation to pollinate, in the interests of the sexual
        reproduction of the plant species. In this sense, in organizing pollination, we are “servicing plant desire”
        (Cielemęcka, Szczygielska, and Sandilands 2019, 6). This reversal is compelling, particularly in restituting
        forms of plant agency within the carceral space of commercial agriculture. In CEAs, however, the practices
        informing a sense of what plants want seems entirely predetermined by questions of yield. The infrastructures of
        greenhouses and vertical gardens coerce human and nonhuman labor towards a libidinal monotony—for the plants,
        who cross pollinate only among themselves, for the laborers who toil among endless rows of a single crop, as
        well as for the bees who, given the chance, escape the greenhouse through airshafts or ventilation channels to
        pollinate more diverse fields outside the prison house of the greenhouse plot.4
        <br><br>
        If vegetal agency is thought to explain the reciprocal capture of humans and nonhumans in and through industrial
        agriculture and its alternatives, the concept must also point to the carceral arc of pollination practices
        across industrial and infrastructural channels in the global system. This expansion of vegetal agency helps
        understand how, in Sandilands terms, all forms of life are being “gardened,” emploted, trained, directed, and
        harvested, in complex relation to growing processes (Cielemęcka, Szczygielska, and Sandilands 2019, 6). Such
        “gardening” practices are pivotal to the languages of “greening economies.” Vegetal agency is also
        instrumentalized through profoundly racialized and sexed categories of fitness, fecundity, and variability,
        which shape the nature of greenhouse inputs, the practices of pollination, and their interrelation in food
        production globally, as well as the ties that bind the varied laborers and labor practices the greenhouse
        encloses. It’s to these categories and imaginaries that I now turn.

        In what follows, we begin by introducing our project on radical pedagogy for games education, then move on to
        explore the institutional contexts we worked within, including the multiple contrasting ontologies of higher
        education that were in play. Ultimately, we demonstrate that we were not always doing the work we thought we
        were doing as we utilized repair strategies embedded within our existing environment versus acting
        transformatively. We identify a framework for understanding the range of challenges associated with
        transformative pedagogy work as characterized by the types of labor used to maintain the status quo, and
        conclude with suggestions for the future to break the cycle of repair and maintenance within the utilization of
        social justice education. Together, the above reflections and analyses provide new understanding about how
        rhetorics of change, progress, repair, and maintenance operate within particular ontologies of higher education
        to inform educators who might aim to advance similar initiatives.

            necessary if one is to confront world histories as histories that one is a part of and accountable to.

            additional context, at the start of our work together on the HCG course, Amy had just transitioned to a
            teaching role at Rensselaer, and initially began adding dialogue into Rebecca’s course as a volunteer
            workshop facilitator. Over several iterations of the course, we continued to work together, and this
            collaboration grew into a fully shared co-facilitation of the course. Even as Amy took on this increased
            role, she was never officially listed as a co-instructor, and her work was officially framed as

            <sup><a href="#note7t">7</a></sup> For example, we invited male games faculty and department leadership to
            observe our dialogue class, and while they appreciated the content, they questioned why we were using a
            multipartial facilitation approach versus advocacy facilitation methods in the inclusion of social justice
            education in the course (Fisher and Petryk 2017).One colleague seemed befuddled by our dialogic approach,
            because he found success in simply telling his students what is right and wrong, in terms of labeling
            certain game designs as racist or sexist. These comments demonstrated a lack of understanding of dialogic
            pedagogy in aiming to share power in the classroom and have students feel open to sharing their own life
            experiences in order to increase understanding across difference. This reaction likely also reflects the
            unexamined privilege and power our colleagues hold as male instructors in the games classroom. Given their
            social identity alignment with dominant power holders in games, and the majority of students in the
            classroom, our male colleagues do probably have some degree of success with more advocacy-based teaching
            methods, which we knew from experience were not productive for us to employ.</a>

            faculty from multiple schools and staff from the Student Life division were also invited to participate in a
            multiday training on intergroup dialogue and facilitation from the University of Michigan’s Program on
            Intergroup Relations in the summer of 2019. The training was collaborative and highly engaging, yet there
            were few inroads made on future plans and sustainable change to curriculum and programs. There were multiple
            times during the workshop when participants highlighted the limitations and bureaucratic red tape (funding
            resources, curriculum change approvals, abilities to co-facilitate with staff, confidence in facilitation
            abilities etc.) that they feared would curtail their abilities to fully implement dialogue. Participants
            left focusing more on smaller scale changes that they could make in their spheres of influence, such as
            individual classrooms and departments, but without a plan for larger structural support to advance the work
            in community. Further training with the University of Michigan occurred in the summer of 2021, leading to
            plans of intergroup dialogue courses in the spring and summer of 2022.</a>

            and often functions as a gatekeeper to prevent “others” from entry or success within STEM disciplines. See
