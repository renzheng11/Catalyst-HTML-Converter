### Notes 

^1^ Not all queer and transgender people, including my interview
participants, use these terms to describe their bodies. All direct
quotes contain the words that participants used to describe themselves.

^2^ For the most part, the literature on "women who have sex with women"
assumes, but does not state, that "women" is synonymous with "cisgender
women."

^3^ Today, *BDSM* is the most common acronym to refer to the community,
whereas in the era I discuss in this paragraph it was more common to use
*SM*.

^4^ All interviews took place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and thus
reflect sexual interactions that took place before the widespread
disruptions to social and sexual life.

^5^ "Strapped" refers to a cock (e.g., dildo) that the user straps to
their body with a harness. "Strapless" refers to a cock that is attached
to the body (that someone was born with or had surgically constructed)
that does not require a harness.
