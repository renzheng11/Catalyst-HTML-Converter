    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">Abstract</p>
    <p class="c1">There is an abundance of scholarship on knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes related to safer sex
        technologies and practices, including a growing body of work that analyses the politics of pre-exposure
        prophylaxis (PrEP). However, there is comparatively little research that applies a queer feminist science and
        technology studies lens to safer sex technologies and practices other than condoms and PrEP. This paper draws on
        archival research and thirty-two in-depth interviews with queer- and trans-identified adults about how they make
        sense of safer sex practices and technologies, in particular gloves and dams as barriers. I argue that the
        social world of queer safer sex is marked by ambivalent technologies. For users and non-users, the main
        affective investment in using gloves and dams is one of ambivalence as they attempt to make sense of their own
        bodies, relationships, and communities while navigating discourses around risk and sexual health. Ambivalent
        technologies are also entangled with discourses of risk, governmentality, and community care. Attending to the
        social worlds of queer safer sex technologies provides insights that are not attainable through behavioral or
        epidemiological research.</p>

    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">Introduction</p>
    <p class="c1">
        The point of departure for this project began with my observations about the politics surrounding a specific
        safer sex practice germane to queer communities: the use of latex or nitrile gloves for hand sex (penetration of
        the vagina or anus with fingers or hands).<sup><a href="#note1b"
            id="note1t">1</a></sup> Among the queer folks I shared community with, most of them assigned
        female at birth (AFAB), gloves represented a highly contentious practice. Some people swore by gloves and would
        not have sex without them; others kept a box under their bed just in case a lover requested their use. Still
        others refused to use them, citing the lack of the scientific evidence to support their use and their complicity
        in the notion that queer bodies are dirty and need to be contained. An interaction that highlighted the analytic
        importance of gloves occurred when a friend, who knew about my research and occasional moonlighting as a queer
        safer sex educator, asked why I advocated for glove use: “You’re a researcher, so you probably know there isn’t
        any research documenting the effectiveness of using gloves for an already very low-risk sexual practice.”
        <br><br>
        Largely stumped by this question, I mumbled something about barriers preventing more than just transmission of
        infection and the need to think capaciously about what constitutes “safer sex.” The point, however, was well
        taken: the gaps between the practice of glove use and their relationship to scientific knowledge raised
        important questions about the social and political contexts of queer safer sex: In the absence of known clinical
        effectiveness in preventing disease transmission, what is the social significance of technologies such as the
        use of gloves and dental dams? What cultural or political work is accomplished by the affective investment in
        these technologies in queer communities? I focus on gloves and dams because they are objects generally signified
        as queer. Of course, any person can use them regardless of sexual identity or behavior, but gloves and dams are
        seldom promoted to or used by heterosexuals. Rather than asking biomedical, behavioral, or epidemiological
        questions about the efficacy of gloves and dams, the rates of their use, or how to better promote them, this
        article asks a different set of questions. My aim is to disrupt the focus of normative behavioral or policy
        research on safer sex by generating queer feminist science and technology insights into these technologies.
        Drawing on my extensive archive of safer sex materials from 1982 to the present and thirty-two in-depth
        individual interviews with queer adults in the United States and Canada, I explore the politics of gloves and
        dams through the “social worlds” framework and queer feminist science and technology studies. The social worlds
        framework originates in feminist sociological studies of science and technology. According to Adele Clarke and
        Leigh Star, the social worlds “theory-methods package” includes “epistemological and ontological assumptions,
        along with concrete practices” through which social interactions occur, “including relating to/with one another
        and with the various nonhuman entities involved in the situation” (2008, 117). I combine this framework with
        insights from queer feminist science and technology studies, which is concerned with the quotidian practices of
        meaning making that trouble, disrupt, and reconfigure assumptions about nature, difference, and worldliness—in
        my case, the queer disruptions of sex, “safer” sex, gender, and bodies through safer sex technologies such as
        gloves and dams (Cipolla et al. 2017). Together, these frameworks demonstrate how gloves and dams are ambivalent
        technologies entangled with discourses of risk, governmentality, and care in queer social worlds. The concept of
        ambivalent technologies helps us to understand why people use these technologies in the absence of known
        scientific effectiveness; it also illustrates the social and political significance of these technologies.

    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">
        A Short and Incomplete Genealogy of Gloves and Dams for Safer Sex
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
        Although there is a growing body of literature that explores the social and political meanings of the
        biochemical safer sex technology pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (Race 2015; Betts 2021), there is little
        research that analyzes the social meanings of barrier technologies such as gloves and dams. Survey research has
        demonstrated low rates of glove and dam use among queer/lesbian/bisexual women (Richters et al. 2010; McCune et
        al. 2017).<sup><a href="#note2b"
            id="note2t">2</a></sup> One international (though majority US-based sample) study found rates of consistent dam and glove
        use around 3 percent when giving or receiving oral or hand sex (Rowen et al. 2013). Low rates of barrier use
        among queer women are often attributed to the fact that they see themselves to be at low risk for sexually
        transmitted infections (STIs). As Power, McNair, and Carr (2009) argue, this perception is due to how queer
        women usually are excluded from the dominant social scripts of safer sex aimed at heterosexual people and
        cisgender gay men. What is more, there is little to no research demonstrating the efficacy of gloves and dams
        for the prevention of STIs (Richters and Clayton 2010). Although certainly not nonexistent, rates of STIs among
        “women who have sex with women” tend to be comparatively lower than other than heterosexual people and men who
        have sex with men (McCune et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2021). The comparatively lower rates of STIs and the lack
        of inclusion in mainstream safer sex promotion, combined with the unknown efficacy of gloves and dams and their
        low rates of use, has led some scholars to argue that they mainly serve a symbolic, rather than practical,
        purpose (Richters and Clayton 2010).
        <br><br>
        In the early years of the HIV/AIDS crisis, gloves and dental dams transformed into safer sex tools through two
        intertwined social process: activism around the neglect of queer women in HIV-prevention efforts and the risk
        reduction practices of bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism (BDSM) practitioners. In the
        1980s and 1990s, scientific, media, and even some social movement discourses positioned queer women as being at
        no risk for HIV/AIDS (Hollibaugh 1998). Women were often left out of early safer sex education efforts—along
        with being excluded from clinical trials and erased from official case definitions of AIDS (Chris and Pearl
        1990). Gloves and dams emerged as safer sex tools in part because people assigned female at birth had to take
        matters into their hands in the face of government and institutional neglect of their sexual health (Barcelos
        2022). The devastating loss of life and the grossly inadequate response on the part of government authorities
        and researchers during the early years of the HIV/AIDS crisis had ignited political organizing that revolved
        around safer sex and was deeply influenced by the politics of gay liberation and feminist theory (Patton 1996).
        Activists framed queer women’s HIV risk invisibility in term of the overall neglect of women’s health, a
        situation that persists today (Logie 2015). Activists also framed the invisibility of lesbians in the AIDS
        crisis in terms of racism and classism (Chris and Pearl 1990; Hollibaugh 1998). Gloves and dams thus became a
        practice of caring for self and community in the face of oppressive systems that disregarded queer women’s
        health (Hollibaugh 1998). Although the neglect of women’s health meant that there was no scientific evidence to
        back up their use, gloves and dams were tools that signaled a politics of care and resistance. This framing as
        radical community care was salient given how, then and now, media, social movements, and researchers have tended
        to frame women’s caregiving roles in the AIDS crisis in terms of their caregiving for gay men with HIV/AIDS,
        rather than themselves or each other (Manlik 2022; Schulman 2021).
        <br><br>
        Alongside and intertwined with gloves and dams in HIV-prevention activism was the growth of organized queer
        women’s BDSM/leather communities. Historically dominated by cisgender gay men (Rubin 1997), the 1980s saw the
        formation of SM and leather groups such as SAMOIS and later the Outcasts that were rooted in politics of lesbian
        feminism.<sup><a href="#note3b"
            id="note3t">3</a></sup> Risk reduction has always been central to intense physical practices such as impact play or bondage,
        and BDSM practitioners were already using gloves for activities like fisting, piercing, or knife play that could
        involve blood-borne pathogens (SAMOIS 1982; Rubin 1997; Lawrence and Queen 2000). The BDSM community was
        therefore primed to advocate for gloves and dams as tools for safer sex (Lawrence and Queen 2000). Gloves
        reduced the risk of fluid exchange but also served the practical purposes of maximizing the slipperiness of
        lubricant or facilitating clean up. Likewise, the emphasis in BDSM on the eroticization of objects helped to
        incorporate barriers into sexual acts. Support for the use of gloves and dams for safer sex (not solely
        BDSM-related play) can be found in early leatherdyke texts such as SAMOIS’s (1982) Coming to Power and Patrick
        Califia’s (1988) Lesbian SM Safety Manual.
        <br><br>
        Today, safer sex efforts unevenly promote the use of gloves and dams. Although it is common to see their use
        advocated for in educational materials produced in queer communities (such as zines) or by LGBTQ health clinics
        (Barcelos 2022), gloves and dams seldom—if ever—make an appearance in the scientifically “evidence-based”
        comprehensive curricula approved for use in school-based sex education in the US. Similarly, although some
        educational materials promote glove and dam use for people of all genders and embodiments, it is much more
        common to see gloves and dams promoted to people with a vulva/vagina than a penis. In my many years of
        professional work in health promotion and my scholarly research on sexual health, I have not once seen gloves
        promoted to heterosexual, cisgender people; occasionally dental dams will make an appearance, but they are
        usually sidelined in favor of the more common barrier, the condom. It is not just that gloves and dams are
        overwhelmingly promoted to and (sometimes) used by queer-identified people that signifies them as queer
        technologies; as I describe below, they also destabilize normative ideas about risk, gender, and scientific
        knowledge.

    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">
        Studying Queer Safer Sex Technologies
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
        The analysis that follows is based on thirty-two in-depth individual interviews (Compton 2018) focused on
        behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes about safer sex in queer and trans communities and is informed by my extensive
        archival work on LGBTQ safer sex promotion (Barcelos 2022).<sup><a href="#note4b"
            id="note4t">4</a></sup> The inclusion criteria for interview participation
        included age over eighteen years, residence in the US or Canada, and self-identification as queer and/or
        transgender. I did not define these terms for participants and made clear that I understood these terms in their
        broadest sense. With the assistance of one undergraduate and one graduate research assistant, I recruited
        participants through social media, snowball sampling, and the podcast Queering Sex Ed
        (https://www.queersexed.org/). Although we invited participants across the spectrum of gender and sexuality, we
        did not emphasize recruiting gay cisgender men given that such a large body of scholarship has analyzed their
        sexual communities and practices. The average participant age was thirty-one. Despite extensive outreach and the
        interviews being conducted by people of color, the sample was only 22 percent people of color. We acknowledge
        that there is significant research fatigue among queer and trans people of color, which likely contributed to
        this issue. Participants came from a wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and reported occupational
        statuses ranging from home healthcare workers to university professors. Participants were asked to define their
        gender identity and sexual orientation in as many or as few words as they liked.
        <br><br>
        All members of the research team identified as queer, two identified as trans, and two identified as Latinx. I
        trained both research assistants in qualitative interview techniques; all three of us conducted interviews with
        participants either in person or via video chat that lasted approximately one hour. We used a semi-structured
        interview guide focused on participant experiences with sexual health education, the safer sex practices they
        employ and why they do so, their perspectives on community norms or conflicts about safer sex, and any
        inequalities they see regarding safer sex. Participants were entered into a raffle to win one of four
        twenty-five-dollar gift cards to the feminist sex toy retailer Babeland. All interviews were transcribed
        verbatim. Data analysis roughly followed a constructivist grounded theory approach (Charmaz 2014). First, I
        conducted initial segment by segment coding that focused on action, rather than topics. Second, I conducted
        focused coding in which I took all initial codes and compared data to data to refine codes and discarded those
        not relevant to research questions or emerging themes. I then coded all the interviews again using the codebook
        and MaxQDA qualitative data analysis software. Finally, I used theoretical coding with the lens of the social
        worlds framework and queer feminist science and technology studies to develop theoretical insights into the use
        of gloves and dams.
        <br><br>
        Grounded in the symbolic interactionist tradition, the social worlds framework focuses on meaning-making among
        groups of social actors with shared commitments and perspectives as well as individual and collective identities
        (e.g., queer communities, health educators) (Clarke and Star 2008). The framework seeks to understand the nature
        of relations and actions across people (e.g., queers), objects (e.g., safer sex barriers), and discourses (e.g.,
        safer sex promotion) in and between various social worlds. Social worlds analyses focus on studying practices
        (e.g., safer sex) rather than studying individuals (e.g., sexual identities) (Clarke, Friese, and Washburn
        2016). To bring a queer lens to the social worlds framework, I followed Cipolla et al.’s (2017) invocation to
        queer science studies by reading interviews for silences, ruptures, and disruptions.

        Queer People Have a Lot of Feelings about Safer Sex
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
        Across various sexual and gender identities, participants reported engaging in a variety of sex acts, including
        oral sex, anal and vaginal penetrative sex with both strapped and strapless cocks,<sup><a href="#note5b"
            id="note5t">5</a></sup> hand sex, and use of various
        sex toys, all in both individual and group situations. Many participants also reported participation in kink or
        BDSM practices and communities. Nearly all participants reported receiving poor quality sexual health education
        and healthcare encounters that were both heteronormative and cisnormative. In terms of defining safer sex and
        the risks associated with the kinds of sex they have, participants understood “safer sex” and “risk” in flexible
        and contingent ways grounded in interactional, relational, and community contexts. For instance, Jordan<sup><a href="#note6b"
            id="note6t">6</a></sup> (29,
        white, queer, genderqueer) defined safer sex as “acknowledging that there is no safe way to have sex or not have
        sex per se,” and thought of it “more as like everyone determining their own acceptable level of risk, and having
        intentional conversations around that, and boundaries and practices that are in line with what your intentions
        are.” Similarly, Adam, (29, unapologetically Black, queer, genderqueer/transmasculine) explained their
        understanding of risk and safety in terms of disrupting binaries and hinging on relational intimacies: “Safe
        sex/unsafe sex is such a weird binary. Um, but I think if I had to define it for myself, it’s like, how are you
        having sex that feels good to you in ways that make you feel comfortable, right? And, so, even... and that can
        look like, you know, I have oral sex with folks and don’t use barriers, that can look like an unsafe sex
        practice to somebody else but to me, that feels great! And that feels really safe for me.” In Adam’s
        understanding, “safer sex” made little sense as a stable, binary category detached from pleasure and
        context-specific practices. The contingent, flexible way that participants understood “safer sex” mirrored their
        understanding of risk. Largely rejecting a realist interpretation of risk as knowable and stable (Lupton 2006),
        participants negotiated the risk of sexual behaviors in terms of the (lack of) available knowledge about STI
        transmission between various kinds of bodies (especially for trans people with experiences of hormonal or
        surgical gender affirmation), notions of AFAB/AFAB sex as low or no risk (Richters and Clayton 2010), and
        internalized notions of the “risk” of sex as merely pregnancy or HIV. Many participants described risks that
        went beyond infection transmission or unintentional pregnancy, such as social, emotional, and community risks.
        <br><br>
        Similarly, participants described their decisions around safer sex practices as embedded in a complex web of
        community norms and values, negotiations of limited scientific knowledge of efficacy and risk, access to
        knowledge and materials, and the affective dimensions of technology use, such as pleasure or gender affirmation.
        For example, although most participants knew about barriers such as dental dams to reduce the risk of oral sex,<sup><a href="#note7b"
            id="note7t">7</a></sup>
        the majority reported not using them due to the awkwardness of use, their unavailability/price, the way they
        decrease sensation and intimacy, and their lack of known efficacy for a comparatively low-risk sexual practice,
        all factors that have been previously identified in the (extremely minimal) research on dental dams (Richters et
        al. 2010; Rowen et al. 2013). Fitz (30, white, gay, trans man) described barriers for oral sex this way: “I hate
        [them] and I don’t use [them]. Because it’s bad for the environment, and...I, I can’t, I don’t find it
        attractive. Like, if I’m gonna have oral sex anyway, I feel like plastic wrap is not gonna save me.” In his
        estimation, barriers for oral sex were not only unattractive and bad for the environment, they also provided
        little protection from the potential risks of oral sex. Trans participants spoke about the lack of existence of
        gender-affirming barriers for their genitalia; for instance, condoms are usually too large for a trans man’s
        phallus and may be disaffirming to use on a trans woman because of their association as a safer sex technology
        used by men. At the same time, a dental dam is generally too small to use effectively on a trans woman who has a
        penis. Mason (29, Black and Latinx, queer, genderqueer/trans/intersex) explained, “There are people who don't
        know that they can use a combination of gloves and finger cots to work as a condom if they are trans male and
        they’re getting a blowjob! Like, most of the things about DIY [do-it-yourself] safer sex or even having safer
        sex in my own body I learned from other trans people—not medical providers, not even from public health
        conferences I’ve gone to.” Thus, in the absence of available technology and knowledgeable providers, trans
        people relied on sharing community knowledge to learn about and practice safer sex (Latham 2016). None of the
        participants in this study reported using condoms for performing oral sex on a penis. When I asked Alice (28,
        white, queer, trans woman) if she had ever used condoms for oral sex on a penis, she laughed and replied,
        “Yeah…I never thought oral sex with a condom should even be a thing!”
        <br><br>
        The use of gloves for hand sex was not as definitive as barriers for oral sex, with many participants expressing
        that they were open to using them but did not do so regularly. Most participants who did use gloves reported
        doing so for practical reasons, such as easier clean up or protection from jagged nails, rather than preventing
        the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Leila (36, white, queer, cis woman) related a practical
        understanding of gloves: “I've got nails! I'm femme! And shit happens. And tears happen. And any bacteria, even
        just for the cleanliness factor not just for disease-getting factor, you know? There’s bacteria under my nails
        and in my hands and I don’t know you that well, and what your immune system is like, and let’s not take the risk
        to fuck up your pussy so that we can’t keep doing this awesome sex we’re about to have.” Leila and many other
        participants also described using gloves as a strategy to mark various relationship arrangements and
        hierarchies, a practice known as “fluid-bonding.” For instance, those in multiple simultaneous relationships
        would not use gloves with their primary partner but would with all others. Jordan described this practice by
        using the phrase “moving parts” of a relationship arrangement and acknowledged that, “It can be very intimate to
        share fluids, and maybe I don’t want to do that with somebody, or they don’t want to do that with me. So maybe
        the nature of the relationship is to have, like a little more distance than that, or if it’s more casual that
        might feel good.” In this way, gloves functioned as a symbolic barrier (Richters and Clayton 2010) that
        prevented the exchange of feelings rather than infections. Conversely, some participants did relate a more
        adamant philosophy and practice of glove and dam use, as did Saturday (36, white, queer,
        genderqueer/nonbinary/femme), who reported using gloves and dams in most or all of their sexual encounters.
        Saturday stated that many people, especially AFAB people having sex with other AFAB people, did not have
        “adequate information about actual risk factors.” However, for the most part, glove and dam use was a binary
        phenomenon, as Gretchen (34, white, queer/lesbian, gender nonconforming woman) described, “There's almost this
        divide between people who are like, ‘I do this all the time,’ and people who are like, ‘I hardly do that ever.’
        Rather than a spectrum it’s either like ‘I'm into this’ or like ‘that seems like way too much work.’”
        <br><br>
        Indeed, many participants described how the norms around safer sex in their communities were sometimes a source
        of conflict or tension. Notable norms included the use of condoms in gay cisgender male communities—and to some
        extent, among transgender women who were previously connected to gay male communities—and a norm of
        recommending, but not using, gloves and dams among people assigned female at birth. Several participants noted
        the phenomenon of how people in some queer communities promote the use of gloves and dams but do not actually
        use them themselves. Enforcing norms and policing other people’s behavior was a way to maintain boundaries
        around sexual communities of identity. Owen (32, white, queer, trans male) referred to this practice as
        performing the “perfect activist” who “gets tested every three months and always carries, you know, condoms and
        gloves with them.” Participants, or their sexual partners, who were not part of politically queer communities
        generally did not use barriers and were not as knowledgeable about their use. For instance, Gretchen often
        hooked up with women who had previously only had sex with cisgender men and were offended when we she suggested
        using barriers like dams or gloves.
        <br><br>
        Race was an absent presence in the interviews, and by extension, interviewees’ safer sex practices. The
        interviewers asked all participants, “What sorts of inequalities related to safer sex do you see in your
        personal experiences or in queer and/or trans communities more generally?” If they were unsure about the
        question, the interviewer would probe for examples around gender, race, class, relationship arrangements,
        ability, citizenship status, age, size, and desirability. I was interested in issues such as racial power
        dynamics in negotiating safer sex practices, negotiating consent when one or more partnership is disabled, and
        the class implications of when safer sex fails (i.e., the ramifications of getting pregnant or contracting HIV).
        Unsurprisingly, multiply marginalized participants were quick to recount how racism, classism, transphobia,
        ableism, and so on showed up in their safer sex worlds. Mason answered the question by sharing, “the whole race
        thing is just wild, because it’s really easy for trans men who are not perceived as people of color—even if they
        are—to navigate gay spaces because the unabashed people downright saying ‘No fats, no femmes, no chocolate,
        beans or rice’ in their [app] profiles. I do routinely get Grindr messages either reducing me to my race or
        ideas about what I might have in my pants.” Similarly, Adam understood safer sex not only in terms of sexually
        transmitted infections but also from the positionality of a Black trans person. As they explained, “I think
        about safer sex not just as, ‘Am I protecting myself against STIs?’ but also thinking about, like, your
        personhood as somebody who holds other identities. Like, we can't fuck if you’re racist.” Although white
        participants easily named the class implications of expensive queer play parties or the challenges of navigating
        queer sexual community as a disabled person, for the most part they lacked an analysis of how race and
        racialization showed up in safer sex technologies and practices. The privileged afforded by whiteness not only
        buffered them from racist interpersonal interactions, but also provided a degree of protection from the broader
        discursive context in which their sexual practices are rendered dangerous and abject (Bailey 2016). In other
        words, white queers may have internalized messages of queer sex as risky or deviant, but those internalizations
        escaped the intersection of racialized queer sexual deviance.

        Gloves and Dams as Ambivalent Technologies
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
        Multiple social worlds of queer safer sex may exist simultaneously, and my analysis here is not meant to suggest
        a uniform or stable social world. Rather, I use the sensitizing concepts of segments, tools, and boundary
        objects with the lens of queer feminist science studies to illustrate how gloves and dams function as ambivalent
        technologies. Naming gloves and dams as ambivalent objects borrows from Kane Race’s (2015) notion of PrEP as a
        “reluctant object.” For Race, PrEP is a reluctant object because it “may well make a tangible difference to
        people’s lives, but [its] promise is so threatening or confronting to enduring habits of getting by in this
        world that it provokes aversion, avoidance—even condemnation and moralism” (17). Reluctant objects are a matter
        of affective attachments and investments in which people “attach themselves to particular objects, practices,
        devices, positions, and identities” in their attempts to navigate safer sex (18). The overall affective
        investment in gloves and dams is one of ambivalence as both users and non-users attempt to make sense of their
        bodies, relationships, and communities while navigating discourses around risk and sexual health. The
        ambivalence attached to gloves and dams is connected to the lack of known efficacy and the lack of attention
        queer and trans bodies and safer sex needs are afforded in research and education. Ambivalent technologies are
        also entangled with a variety of discursive scientific and community formations (Murphy 2012). Analyzing gloves
        and dams through their entanglements with risk, governmentality, and community care helps us to make sense of
        how these technologies simultaneously constitute, conform to, adapt, disrupt, and push against dominant modes of
        scientific and technological power.
    </p>
    <p class="c1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 subsectionTitle">
        Ambivalent Technologies in Queer Social Worlds
    </p>
    <p class="c1">Segments, or subdivisions of social worlds that shift as shared commitments evolve and reorganize
        (Clarke and Starr 2008), illustrate how ambivalent technologies function in various parts of queer social
        worlds. Interview analysis identified a variety of segments that corresponded to practitioners’ relationship to
        gendered technologies of risk. Participant views on safer sex derived from their relationship to the sexual
        scripts (Power, McNair, and Carr 2009) of particular sexual communities. In one segment, queer people assigned
        female at birth (lesbian and bisexual cisgender women, AFAB nonbinary people, and trans men) having sex with
        other people assigned female at birth negotiated the widespread belief that their sexual practices are of low or
        no risk of sexually transmitted infections. Gay/queer trans men who first entered sexual community through
        participation in queer women’s communities did not learn about nor practice safer sex until they began
        participating in gay cisgender men’s sexual communities. Gay men (both cis and trans) understood condoms to be
        the default safer sex technology;<sup><a href="#note8b"
            id="note8t">8</a></sup> so too did queer cis women who have or have had sex with partners who make
        sperm and trans women who partnered with cis men. Likewise, participants who were not politically queer or an
        active part of queer communities formed a segment in which they had little knowledge of queer safer sex
        practices and did not see value in their use. Glove and dam use was also segmented into those who believed them
        to be a necessary strategy to prevent sexually transmitted infections and those who viewed such barriers as an
        unnecessary burden that serves no purpose.
<br><br>
        Ambivalent technologies like gloves and dams are boundary objects that share mutual concerns with the social
        world of public health: preventing the transmission of microbes and the containment of sexual excess. “Boundary
        objects” are things that exist at junctures where varied social worlds meet in an arena of mutual concern.
        Mainstream public health has long sought to contain and discipline the queer sexual body (Patton 1996). Notably,
        the gloves used for hand sex are the same style and quality of gloves used by health care practitioners in
        clinical settings. As Lisa Jean Moore (1997) points out, the early AIDS crisis had an impact on the supply of
        medical examination gloves as healthcare workers began to use gloves with unanticipated frequency due to fear of
        the contagious queer body. Dental dams were originally developed use to isolate parts of the mouth during a
        dental procedure and remain expensive and inaccessible given the lack of uptake for other uses. These factors
        play into queer ambivalence to using them as safer sex barriers especially given, again, their unknown efficacy
        in preventing STIs during already low-risk activities. At the same time, queer safer sex practitioners
        reconstruct barriers as tools to meet the specific needs placed on them by various segments of the social world
        (Clarke and Star 2008) and their commitments to various social factors (e.g., fluid-sharing norms, sexed and
        gendered embodiment, queer political identity).
        <br><br>
        Gloves and dams are tools that form literal and symbolic boundaries between bodies and relationships in queer
        social worlds. Tools are objects imbued with multiple meanings that “are embedded in the artifacts and the
        practices associated with them” (Moore 1997, 435) and may be practical, material, and/or symbolic. Materially,
        barriers may prevent the sharing of sexual fluids and potentially infection-causing viruses and bacteria.
        Barriers are tools that served a variety of practical functions for participants in this study; for example,
        gloves were tools for easier clean up, protection from fingernail-related injury, and increasing the longevity
        of lube during sex. However, the use of gloves and dams is also ambivalent given the absence of scientific
        evidence to demonstrate their efficacy (Rowen et al. 2013), and thus the barriers carry significant symbolic
        weight. For participants in this study, barriers served socially salient symbolic purposes. While the use of
        condoms or PrEP represents compliance with gendered technologies of safer sex that allow trans men to claim
        membership in cisgender gay male sexual communities, gloves and dams communicate membership into a particular
        queer sexual and social community and thus make individuals legible to themselves and others as queer. For
        instance, gloves are what transform the act of penetrating a partner’s body with fingers or hands into a queer
        sexual act. As some participants pointed out, gloves and dams also symbolized being a “good” queer activist, one
        that always practices safer sex. Finally, both gloves and dams serve as “feelings condoms” to demarcate symbolic
        relationships around fluid-bonding or the seriousness of a relationship.
    </p>

    <p class="c1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 subsectionTitle">Entanglements of Ambivalent Technologies</p>
    <p class="c1">
        Gloves and dams are entangled with discourses of risk, governmentality, and the politics of care. Paradoxically,
        their use argues for an expanded view of queer sex as risky and potentially dangerous. Through their
        entanglements with governmentality, this process can be interpreted as a form of self and collective governance
        that works to (re)pathologize queer sex. To many heterosexual and cisgender people, oral or hand sex is not even
        sex. Queer and trans people have long been forced to engage with biomedical discourses and institutions that
        construct them as dangerous, unhealthy, and deviant. This pathologization is especially true for queer and trans
        people of color, which further complicates affective investments that support the notion that queer sex is
        risky. Moreover, users cannot “know” if using nitrile or latex gloves for hand sex reduces the transmission of
        infection because it has been invisibilized or deprioritized in scientific research. As Juliet Richters and
        Stevie Clayton (2010) point out, from a methodological perspective it would be challenging to design
        population-based studies with the statistical power necessary to establish the efficacy of gloves or dams in
        preventing STI transmission. Because we do not—and possibly cannot—know to what extent gloves and dams reduce
        risk in relatively low-risk sexual practices, the affective investments in ambivalent technologies risks moving
        queer sex from invisibility to pathologization and regulation.
        <br><br>
        Gloves and dams are also entangled with a community ethics of care that has its roots in the legacy of the AIDS
        crisis and the queer politics that emerged from it. Queer communities have long created families of choice and
        organized community caregiving efforts, in large part fueled by an absence of support from social institutions
        and families of origin. Ambivalent technologies are one way in which queer people validate and perform the
        importance of caring for one another outside normative social arrangements. While you may not know exactly how
        much wearing a glove when you fist someone decreases risk of HIV, you do have an affective investment in the
        practice as signaling a politics of care. Because gloves and dams help to construct barriers around community
        and identity—straight people and cis gay men rarely, if ever, use them—their use represents one way of marking
        the legitimacy of queer women and trans folks’ bodies and erotic subjectivities (Latham 2016). This
        legitimization is evidenced by interview participants who used gloves and dams mainly to be seen as politically
        or properly queer. Ambivalent technologies are also strategies for making oneself knowable to both the self and
        to others (though not necessarily to biomedical institutions and discourses). Just as some safer sex
        technologies can be disaffirming to one’s gender or sexuality (e.g., a trans woman using an external condom to
        receive oral sex), they can also help to construct and make visible bodies and identities (e.g., a trans man
        using a cut up glove as an external condom). In this sense, ambivalent technologies are strategies for gender
        affirmation.
        <br><br>
        It is critical to interrogate how ambivalent technological entanglements with risk, governance, and community
        signal or foreclose a liberatory queer politics that incorporates an analysis of race, disability, and power.
        For instance, in what ways do the politics of safer sex technologies rely on ideas about sick and disabled
        bodies as abject positions to be avoided through preventative behaviors? Likewise, as the majority white sample
        in this project made clear, queer people who do not experience racialized pathologization may have a keener
        affective investment in ambivalent technologies. How might barrier-free sex, as Marlon Bailey articulates,
        satisfy a craving for “a deep intimacy, a closeness and a being desired and wanted” in a world in which
        racialized sexual others are rarely desired and wanted, either by the state or by white queers on hook-up apps
        (2016, 253)? Can ambivalent technologies shift the larger social and political processes that position some
        queer and trans lives as worth saving and mark others for premature death? Does using gloves to fist your lover
        do anything to address structural violence? In other words, what are queers really at risk for, and how do
        ambivalent technologies such as gloves and dams both reproduce and resist barriers to social, economic, and
        political freedom?
    </p>
    <p class="c1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 sectionTitle">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="c1">
        Amid the prolific amount of behavioral, clinical, and epidemiological literature on safer sex—especially the
        growing body of work on PrEP—it is important to consider the social processes through which safer sex plays out
        (Auerbach and Hoppe 2015). This paper presents one view into the social world of gloves and dams, but it is of
        course not the only one. Although the sample was diverse in terms of gender, sexual orientation, class
        background, and age, the majority of participants were white. Additionally, participants lived across the US and
        Canada, rather than a geographically bounded community. The analysis of these findings is not generalizable in
        the sense of applying the findings to the safer sex practices of queer and transgender adults as a whole, but it
        does contribute an understanding of safer sex practices that is not attainable through behavioral research.
        Instead of simply asking how many people use do or do not use safer sex technologies, this study has provided a
        way to think about the social significance of their use. Future research on the social worlds of queer safer sex
        technologies might analyze differences in the understanding and negotiation of glove and dam use, risk, and
        norms. For instance, trans male participants in this study largely did not learn about safer sex until they were
        exposed to gay cisgender male communities, and safer sex technologies specifically for trans bodies are sparse.
        Researchers might also consider how the shifting technological and scientific world of safer sex, namely PrEP,
        affects the perception of risk and safer sex practices in communities both targeted and not-targeted for
        biochemical prophylaxis. Future research can better explicate how whiteness informs queer and trans
        understandings of safer sex as well as how queer and trans people of color (other than gay cisgender men of
        color) navigate sexual racism in relation to safer sex negotiations. At a moment when widespread use of PrEP in
        some communities has changed definitions of “safe sex,” it is all the more important to analyze how public
        health discourses position racialized queer and trans bodies in relation to risk, and for whom PrEP use is
        compulsory rather than liberatory (Bailey 2016; Betts 2021). And of course, HIV transmission is not the only
        concern that falls under the rubric of “safer sex,” but it is among the most salient given its importance in
        igniting queer safer sex organizing efforts and how it remains discursively linked to queer sexuality.
