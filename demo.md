### Introduction

This article proposes that post-developmental early childhood education
pedagogies can engage withearly childhood
education. I hope that the propositions this article offers will open
space for generating locally meaningful experiments in weaving
pedagogies with physiologies differently in other contexts.

I begin by discussing how physiology, as a powerful Euro-Western
knowledge, perpetuates c

### Physiology and Pedagogies: CSEP's Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth

Pedagogical resources that tout physical activity recommendations,
outline physical literacy programming, and detail the necessity of
educating young children in healthy nutrition habits are increasingly
prevalent in Canadian early vity" \[2\]), while the step category
details additional required physical activity ("several hours of a
variety of structured and unstructured light physical activities"
\[2\]). The guidelines note that children

### Detailing Physiology as a Euro-Western Knowledge

Physiology---as one knowledge production apparatus of Euro-Western
settler colonial epistemic hegemony (Haraway and Subramaniam 2021; Lyons
et al. 2017; McKittrick 2021; Roy and Subramaniam 2016; Sanabria 2016;
TallBear 2013; Willey 2016)---is the science of how a living body
functions. I think with physiology in this article because it is a core
knowledge that informs mainstream physical education pedagogy. As a
Euro-Western 

#### Concealing How Physiology Entangles with Pedagogies

By curating the foundational features of physical activity pedagogies
that can become subject to pedagogical purview, dominant physical
education pedagogies ensure their educational authority and secure the
dominance of settler-colonial onto-epistemological paradigms. When
pedagogical resources are framed as well-founded and incontestable
dictates ("optimal health benefits" can be achieved by following the
*Guidelines*), debating the (physiological, ontological, ethical)
principles that underpin their content becomes unnecessary. This
constructed certainty

#### Intervening with/in Physiology 

Taking physiology to account with pedagogies, I confront singular,
authoritative, and non-complex/complexifiable assertions of dominant
physiological sciences as they matter in pedagogical resources and work
to engage these knowledges beyond their claims to certainty. This
article is certainly not the.

### Post-Developmental Pedagogies and Physiological Knowledges

Following from critical reconceptualist early years scholarship that has
extricated pedagogy from universalized scientific evidence-based
prescription (Cannella 1997; Dahlberg, Moss, and Pence 2013; Kessler and
Swadener 1992; MacNaughton 2000), post-develop.

#### Doing Physiological Knowledges with Post-developmental Pedagogies

I experiment with two propositions for bringing physiological knowledges
and pedagogies into unfamiliar.

#### Meeting EPOC

"Oxygen debt," "after burn," and "raised metabolism" are some of the
names EPOC colloquiall.

#### EPOC as a Problem *with* Pedagogy

To pose physiological knowledges as a problem with post-developmental
pedagogies, I invoke a specific conception of what it is to problematize
or what it means to take as a problem.

##### Pedagogical problems of response with EPOC

EPOC engenders a logic of response: the harder an agential human
exercises their muscles, the greater the demand on metabolic resources
within muscles, more resources are consumed and must be regenerated, and
thus a greater EPOC is created.

##### Pedagogical problems of transaction with EPOC

Transactional logic animates another EPOC physiology. EPOC is made
visible as the exchange of oxygen for the release of stored muscular
energy, as cellular metabolic substrates swap for muscular contraction.

#### Generating Pedagogical Provocations to Think Differently with Physiological Knowledges

After working two EPOC physiological knowledges into problems with
post-developmental pedagogies.

##### Pedagogical provocations of responsivity

In taking EPOC response physiological knowledges as a problem for
pedagogies, I wondered how EPOC might spawn problems of responsivity
with pedagogy: How is the "response" practiced by EPOC im/perceptible to
the responsivenesses of pedagogy*?*

##### Pedagogical provocations of transactionality

Posing EPOC's transactional logic as a problem with pedagogy, I asked
how EPOC transactions might matter with pedagogical modes of exchange*.*
Thinking with post-developmental pedagogies, I can take up the
im/perceptibility of economic/metabolic transactional logic, tracing
where this logic emerges in children's everyday engagements and where it
intrudes into encounters.

### Towards a *Why* for Doing Physiological Knowledges Differently with Pedagogies

In mainstream early childhood education in Canada, physiology often
matters as physical activity guidelines, nutrition recommendations, and
normative developmental dictates.
